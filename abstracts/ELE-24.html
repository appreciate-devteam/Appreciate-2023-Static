                    Two-Wheeler Vehicles such as Motorcycles are much more prone to theft compared to Four-Wheeler
Vehicles because they are much easier to access, and their security is inferior compared to cars that
have doors before you can access the key slot. According to Statista, there were 53,111 accumulated
number of motorcycles that were stolen in 2020. That was the total number of motorcycle thefts for
the 50 states of United States of America. Innovative measures that lean to the technological
advancement of how Motorcycles are manufactured is the main goal of this study. Rather than having
just a normal unsecured key slot, installing a multi-factor authentication as an advanced method of
access for motorcycle will provide a higher security for Motorcycles. Multi-factor Authentication
(MFA) is a security process in which users provide two different authentication factors in 3 different
ways to authenticate to verify the identity. The implementation of MFA improves the security of both
user credentials and the resources that users can access. In addition to that is the integrated security
features of automated alert messaging system, self-capturing camera, and a Global Positioning System
(GPS) tracker that will locate the motorcycle if all else fails and the vehicle was lifted. If the user ever
encountered an error, the Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) card can bypass all security which
can only be used in times of emergency. The multiple factor verification system was developed using
an ESP8266 as the main component. The code for the system was added using Arduino IDE as its
programming platform. The passcode was made first by using Multisim or Tinker Cad to draft the
simulations, and then later an actual breadboard was used to execute the schematic diagram. GPS
tracker was developed by using different hardware such as Tiny Duino processor board (with Lithium
Battery Support), USB Tiny Shield, Flash Memory Tiny Shield, GPS Tiny Shield, Mounting Kit,
Lithium-Ion Polymer Battery (3.7V 270 maH). Arduino IDE was also used in creating the GPS
tracker. C++ programming language was used for the automated alert messages and self-capturing
camera. Upon doing a series of unauthenticated inputs through the application, we were able to record
10 different alert messages and photo captured stored in the application. We also tested the GPS
tracker by travelling a 1km ride, it recorded 10 different coordinates within the map. The RFID card
was also scanned multiple times to check if there will be an error, 10 out of 10 scans were able to
bypass the security of the Motorcycle.
