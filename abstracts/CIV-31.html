                    <h4>Radiation Shielding Property of Philippine Marble Sand in Concrete as Partial Replacement to Fine Aggregates</h4>
                  <!-- </a> -->

                  <p class="description">
                    Concrete is the most predominantly construction material that is employed ubiquitously
owing for its strength, durability, and cost-effectiveness. Unfortunately, a specific property of
concrete is frequently overlooked: the ability of concrete to shield radiation and lessen its
harmful effects. The researchers of this study integrated marble sand into concrete as a partial
replacement for fine aggregates to increase its radiation-shielding capabilities, knowing that
marble sand’s chemical composition: calcium, carbon, and oxygen in the formation of calcite
(as seen through Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis) -
that aid in minimizing damage to the atomic structure and properties of concrete after
irradiation. The incorporation of the aforementioned variable has likewise enhanced the
mechanical qualities of concrete. The researchers employed a control group with 100%
commercialized lahar sand and a treatment group with three different ratios of marble sand as
fine aggregate substitutes: 25%, 50%, and 75%. The marble sand used came from the Teresa
Marble Company from Teresa, Rizal, and the marble sand used are the retained aggregates at
sieve No. 200 (75 μm). The study&#39;s samples were produced in compliance with ASTM
standards, and M20 grade concrete design mix was employed. After curing for 7, 14, and 28
days, the samples were evaluated using a Compression Testing Machine. At this point, the
physical characteristics indicated that marble sand has a specific gravity of 2.87, which is
higher than that of lahar sand, which is 2.67. This outcome is advantageous for concrete&#39;s
radiation resistance since a greater specific gravity result in a heavier density and better
radiation shielding properties. Moreover, results from the 7 th day of curing indicate that the
addition of marble sand enhanced the compressive, split tensile, and flexural strength of
concrete. For compressive and split tensile, 50% replacement was ideal, while for flexural,
75% replacement was optimal.
As of now, this study is currently 14 and 28 days into its curing procedure. The specimens
were still awaiting testing in Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Compression Testing
Machine, Electromagnetic Interference Test and Radiation Shielding Test.
