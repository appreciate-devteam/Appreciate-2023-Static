                  <p class="description">
                    This study presents a Smart Parking Management System that utilizes deep learning algorithms for
vehicle detection and license plate recognition, with the aim of providing an efficient parking system
using technological advancements. The purpose of this project is to address common parking
management problems such as inefficient resource utilization and manual payment systems. The
experimental approach involves the replacement of traditional physical sensors with cameras to detect
available parking spots in real-time. Masked Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-
RCNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 5 are used for vehicle detection and license plate
recognition, respectively. The Mask-RCNN algorithm generates a bounding box around each vehicle,
which is used to determine parking availability, while the YOLOv5 algorithm detects and recognizes
the license plate numbers of incoming vehicles. Information is stored in an online database, which
registered users can access through a web-based application to search for available parking spaces and
view a parking lot map. The Mask-RCNN algorithm showed promising results in detecting vehicles
and determining parking availability. However, preliminary testing showed that several factors affect
the accuracy of the algorithm, such as camera angle, lighting conditions, and the presence of
overlapping objects in the camera images. The YOLOv5 algorithm demonstrated strong performance
in detecting and recognizing license plates. However, its accuracy is affected by several factors such
as image quality, lighting conditions, and the angle and distance of the camera. Additionally,
variations in license plate fonts and sizes also affect the algorithm&#39;s ability to accurately recognize and
read the license plate numbers. While the experimental results of this study are promising, it is
important to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system under various conditions and scenarios.
In conclusion, the Smart Parking Management System proposed in this study demonstrates the
potential of deep learning algorithms in addressing common parking management problems. By
utilizing real-time vehicle detection and license plate recognition, the system offers an innovative and
efficient approach to parking management, with potential benefits such as optimized resource
utilization and reduced operational costs. Further research and development are necessary to fully
assess the system&#39;s effectiveness and optimize its performance for different real-world scenarios.
