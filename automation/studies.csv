replacement to cement and fine aggregates. The utilization of 9 different mix proportions aimed to
determine the most suitable proportion of replacement. 0%, 15%, 20%, 25% by weight of Type 1T
Cement was replaced with CCA, and 0%, 20%, 25%, 30% by weight of Fine aggregates was replaced
with CMS, having the 0% replacement as the control. 3 different mix proportions with both CCA and
CMS replacement were also made. In addition, this study sought to test the concrete bricks cured in 7, 14,
and 28 days in terms of their water absorption, compressive and flexural strength. In reference to
preliminary studies, waste mussel shells and corn cobs are expected to be an effective partial
replacements for cement and fine aggregates in concrete brick production. Concrete bricks produced
using these waste materials are anticipated to exhibit comparable physical and mechanical properties to
those produced using traditional materials, with the optimum proportion of replacement being 15% CCA

One of
the most produced crops in the Philippines is corn. Corn is one of the major crops consumed by
humans and is also used for industrial and poultry purposes. Environmental products are one way of
solving environmental problems and developing new materials. The continuous trend of composite
materials and food carts stimulated the demands of customers and entrepreneurs. Collapsible furniture
has the advantage of being able to be stored in small spaces. The researcher of this study aimed to
develop a collapsible food cart using corn cob composite board reinforced with corn husk fiber with
polyester resin as binder. The composite board is primarily made up of corn cob (CC) and reinforced
with corn husk fiber (CHF). Optimum mix ratio of CC, CHF, and Binder are identified which
established as the most durable and sustainable composite board. The composite board will be used in
fabricating the collapsible food cart. Turning the corn wastes into valuable material will help the
aspiring entrepreneurs and society in their living. It is expected that the boards, which undergone

using substitute reinforcement, such as the traditional construction material Bamboo (Bambusa
Merrilliana), as partial reinforcement. The purpose of this research is to conduct an experimental

to determine whether bamboo could be used as an alternative reinforcement for a non-load bearing
wall panel. It will be held at Technological University of the Philippines - Manila during the academic
year 2022-2023, and the obtained results will be compared to those obtained through experimentation
and various testing methods to verify the simulation results. The results of the numerical analysis
demonstrated that the partition wall reinforced with Bambusa Merrilliana had a greater load-bearing
capacity and stiffness than the partition wall without reinforcement. Additionally, the Bambusa
Merrilliana reinforcement enhanced the overall performance of the partition wall by decreasing
deflection and increasing its energy absorption capacity. The study concluded that Bambusa
Merrilliana is an effective material for partition wall reinforcement. The results of the FEA simulation
demonstrated that the incorporation of Bambusa Merrilliana can enhance the flexural behavior and

with similar diameter of 65mm and by inserting a 250mm bamboo with 55mm diameter inside it, while the bolts
served as the connector. These samples have different configuration of number of bolts, edge distance, and bolt
spacing depending on the bolt’s diameter. The samples’ strength capacity was investigated using uniaxial tension
tests under the ISO 22157-1:2004 standard. In addition, a simulation analysis was conducted through finite
element analysis (FEA) in ANSYS to verify the results obtained from the actual test. The actual test stated that
bamboo samples with 4 bolts with diameters of 10mm have the highest strength capacity among others. Through
verification of results in ANSYS, it may have little discrepancy, but still gave similar conclusion with the actual

reduce and conserve natural resources, promote responsible consumption and production, and develop
innovative practices and techniques for constructing sustainable buildings and infrastructure. This
research investigates the physical and mechanical properties of concrete paving blocks with partial
replacement of sand by a mixture of crushed mussel shells and low-density polyethylene (LDPE)
plastic pellets. A trial mixture was done to determine the suitable water/cement ratio (0.62, 0.7, 0.75).
The results showed that the most appropriate w/c ratio is 0.7, which produced the paving blocks with
the desired properties. Three mixes were designed with varying proportions of the mixture, ranging
from 5% to 15% replacement of sand. Concrete paving blocks with dimensions of 200mm x 100mm x
60mm were tested for compressive strength and water absorption in accordance with relevant ASTM
standards. Considering partial results, paving blocks with replacement of up to 15% by the mixture
can meet the minimum strength requirements. As the proportion of the mixture increases, the water
absorption of the blocks improves, indicating an increase in durability. The results of the study

concrete properties and prevent calcium carbonate from leaching out. However, external water could
not penetrate through the hardened concrete which leads to premature hydration. To maintain
satisfactory temperature and moisture condition, internal curing provides internal water reservoirs in a
concrete mixture that prolongs cement hydration. The researchers aim to investigate the effects on the
physical and mechanical properties of concrete using lime water-saturated pumice for internal curing.
This study aims to determine the implications of using different concentrations of lime water for
internal curing on the properties of concrete. This study adapted the ACI 211.1-91 (Standard Practice
for Selecting Proportions for Normal, Heavyweight, and Mass Concrete) to generate three different
concrete mix designs and then manipulated using the Bentz and Snyder Equation for internal curing to
create five mix designs with varying lime water concentrations (0%, 20%, 40%, 50%, and 60%). The
parameters studied in this experiment are compressive, split-tensile strength, flexural strength,
concrete density, and workability. All experiments were conducted based on their respective ASTM
standard test method. A Total of 486 concrete samples were tested on the 7 th , 14 th , and 28 th day using
the Universal Testing Machine. The expected results suggest little improvement in the unit weight and
workability of concrete. However, there is a significant difference in the mechanical properties of
concrete wherein compressive, split-tensile, and flexural strength of internally cured concrete
increases as the age of concrete progresses.","SDG: Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

owing for its strength, durability, and cost-effectiveness. Unfortunately, a specific property of
concrete is frequently overlooked: the ability of concrete to shield radiation and lessen its
harmful effects. The researchers of this study integrated marble sand into concrete as a partial
replacement for fine aggregates to increase its radiation-shielding capabilities, knowing that
marble sand’s chemical composition: calcium, carbon, and oxygen in the formation of calcite
(as seen through Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis) -
that aid in minimizing damage to the atomic structure and properties of concrete after
irradiation. The incorporation of the aforementioned variable has likewise enhanced the
mechanical qualities of concrete. The researchers employed a control group with 100%
commercialized lahar sand and a treatment group with three different ratios of marble sand as
fine aggregate substitutes: 25%, 50%, and 75%. The marble sand used came from the Teresa
Marble Company from Teresa, Rizal, and the marble sand used are the retained aggregates at
sieve No. 200 (75 μm). The study&#39;s samples were produced in compliance with ASTM
standards, and M20 grade concrete design mix was employed. After curing for 7, 14, and 28
days, the samples were evaluated using a Compression Testing Machine. At this point, the
physical characteristics indicated that marble sand has a specific gravity of 2.87, which is
higher than that of lahar sand, which is 2.67. This outcome is advantageous for concrete&#39;s
radiation resistance since a greater specific gravity result in a heavier density and better
radiation shielding properties. Moreover, results from the 7 th day of curing indicate that the
addition of marble sand enhanced the compressive, split tensile, and flexural strength of
concrete. For compressive and split tensile, 50% replacement was ideal, while for flexural,
75% replacement was optimal.
As of now, this study is currently 14 and 28 days into its curing procedure. The specimens

To
address this problem, the energy sector is promoting the use of fossil fuels and renewable energy
sources. Biogas technology, which utilizes organic waste to produce energy, is a sustainable and
effective solution for both energy production and solid waste management. Bioptimize proposes a
new approach to increase biogas production in small-scale biodigesters through the integration of
machine learning and a control system. This system increases biogas production by correlating pH
level with biogas production, enabling it to identify the optimal pH level that yields maximum biogas
production at a given temperature value. It also uses sensors to record parameters such as temperature,
pH, gas, and pressure, which are transmitted to a microprocessor that runs an optimization algorithm.
The system then returns a specific pH value, and the electronic solenoid valve regulates the flow of
pH accordingly. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, experiments were conducted to
compare the biogas production of a traditional biodigester without pH control and mixing to a
biodigester with pH control and intermittent mixing. Results from experiments indicate that
combining a pH control system with intermittent mixing can significantly increase biogas yield. The
biodigester with pH control and mixing generated at least double the amount of biogas in comparison
to the conventional biodigester lacking these functionalities. Therefore, incorporating a pH control
system with intermittent mixing is considered a key parameter in biogas production, offering a clean
and efficient alternative energy source for the future.",SDG: Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

during rainy seasons, also when it is summer season it consumes days to make daing. Unfortunately, there
are a lot of external factors that can affect the traditional way of producing daing, such as cats, air
pollutants, rains, and other parasites. As such, the researchers of this study aimed to develop a Arduino-
based fish frying machine through air preheating and dehumidification. Specifically, the machine has a
fish container that can accommodate 6-8 kg of fish, it consists of two heating elements, tungsten heater
for indoor use, and Fresnel lens for outdoor use that controlled by Arduino with alarm system,
temperature, and humidity sensor. The program provides a user-friendly display of setting the minimum
and maintaining temperature, and the time how long it will proceed to drying process. Three days of
testing with different time 8,9, and 7 hours respectively was conducted to three types of fish such as
Galunggong (small and medium), Bisugo, and Espada to gather results for drying time in 45-60 of
temperature. The results show the weight loss percentage of each fish to confirm the dryness and in Day 1
within 8 hours of drying process the average weight loss percentage of the test was 57%, for Day 2 within
9 hours of drying process the average weight loss percentage of the test was 66%, and for Day 3 within 7
hours of drying process the average weight loss percentage of the test was 53%. All the test was resulted
to 1% humidity at the end of their drying time.","SDG: Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and

mill rotor consisting of 8 blades for two rods and seven blades for the other 2 rods placed inside a circular
plate to pulverize the carbonized coconut shell during the process. The mixer chambers have a double
helical blade where the bigger blade has 290 mm for its outside diameter and the smaller blade has 210
mm for its inside blade. The machine can produce 62 kg of charcoal dough per hour after pulverizing and
mixing. The machine uses two electrical motors to help reduce noise pollution. A 1750 rpm motor runs
the pulverizer with an equivalent of 1 horsepower (Hp) and a 1750 rpm gear motor runs the mixer with a
ratio of 1:40. The hammer mill rotor can pulverize a carbonized coconut shell with a particle size of 1 mm

previous attempts to create a low-cost NPWT device have been made, they often lack features and
produce strident noise. The development of a cost-effective NPWT device called LUNAS addresses
the concerns of cost and noise reduction. The study integrates various components such as a micro
vacuum pump, pressure sensor, motor driver, and Arduino Mega to implement functionalities like
pressure monitoring and controlling, modes of operation, and leak detection by developing a program
through the use of the Arduino IDE in the NPWT system. The device&#39;s noise reduction is achieved by
utilizing optimized acoustic polyurethane foam, specifically mushroom-shaped polyurethane foam,
which provides the best noise reduction of up to 10 dB. Based on the results, the average noise level
produced by LUNAS is 23.7 dB, which is significantly lower than the University of the Philippines -
Philippine General Hospital’s (UP-PGH) improvised NPWT, which produces an average noise level
of 60 dB. Meanwhile, after conducting five tests from their preliminary calibration, the average
percent error obtained between the set and measured pressure values is 2.64%; furthermore, the
proponents are aiming 95% accuracy for the final calibration to be conducted with the experts.

vehicle detection and license plate recognition, with the aim of providing an efficient parking system
using technological advancements. The purpose of this project is to address common parking
management problems such as inefficient resource utilization and manual payment systems. The
experimental approach involves the replacement of traditional physical sensors with cameras to detect
available parking spots in real-time. Masked Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-
RCNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 5 are used for vehicle detection and license plate
recognition, respectively. The Mask-RCNN algorithm generates a bounding box around each vehicle,
which is used to determine parking availability, while the YOLOv5 algorithm detects and recognizes
the license plate numbers of incoming vehicles. Information is stored in an online database, which
registered users can access through a web-based application to search for available parking spaces and
view a parking lot map. The Mask-RCNN algorithm showed promising results in detecting vehicles
and determining parking availability. However, preliminary testing showed that several factors affect
the accuracy of the algorithm, such as camera angle, lighting conditions, and the presence of
overlapping objects in the camera images. The YOLOv5 algorithm demonstrated strong performance
in detecting and recognizing license plates. However, its accuracy is affected by several factors such
as image quality, lighting conditions, and the angle and distance of the camera. Additionally,
variations in license plate fonts and sizes also affect the algorithm&#39;s ability to accurately recognize and
read the license plate numbers. While the experimental results of this study are promising, it is
important to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system under various conditions and scenarios.
In conclusion, the Smart Parking Management System proposed in this study demonstrates the
potential of deep learning algorithms in addressing common parking management problems. By
utilizing real-time vehicle detection and license plate recognition, the system offers an innovative and
efficient approach to parking management, with potential benefits such as optimized resource
utilization and reduced operational costs. Further research and development are necessary to fully

maximize e-commerce. Despite the convenience, one of this industry&#39;s challenges is when customers
cannot receive the parcels immediately for several reasons. A common practice by couriers is leaving
the parcels unattended in unsafe and exposed areas, increasing the risk of theft, disturbing the traffic
flow along the corridors and lobby of residential buildings, and increasing their exposure to
contaminants. To address this problem, the researchers designed and fabricated a four-compartment
locker that served as the couriers&#39; drop-off and customers&#39; pick-up points for parcels and food
deliveries. This study has an integrated QR code-reading system for its security, a UV disinfection
system, and an SMS notification system to notify the customers upon the arrival of their parcel. The
customers can customize the settings of these features on a developed website, accessible on both
computers and smartphones. The weight-capacity test revealed that each compartment has a limited
handling capacity of 5 kg, making it suitable for small to medium packages. Meanwhile, given
adequate lighting, the QR code-reading system showed 100% accuracy, with a response time of less
than 2 seconds. The SMS notification system also showed a 100% success rate in delivering SMS to
couriers and customers throughout the trials, with an average response time of 3.42 seconds. On the
other hand, tests showed that this project will only be functional if it is connected to a network with a
data transfer rate of at least 5mbps.","SDG: Goal 11: Make Cities and Human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable"

EC-GSM-IoT technology to provide real-time monitoring of the secondary transformer Distribution
system, enabling the detection of abnormal power consumption patterns that may Indicate electricity
theft. The results of our testing demonstrate that SAEMOS is a highly effective tool for real-time
monitoring, detection, and notification of electricity theft. Using the 4.5 % criteria as an Indicator to
differentiate a false alarm detection from a genuine pilferage. The device’s smart Sensors and EC-
GSM-IoT technology offer a high degree of scalability, enabling easy deployment Across multiple

power source. The system is designed to manage and secure library books by implementing
an RFID tagging system that allows for efficient tracking of book movements and inventory.
The anti-theft feature of the system utilizes an alarm system that is triggered when a book is
removed without proper checkout procedures. The system is also equipped with a dual power
source, consisting of both a solar and an AC power source, which ensures uninterrupted
operation even during power outages. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller to control
the RFID reader, LCD display, and alarm system. The RFID reader communicates with the
microcontroller to retrieve information from the tags attached to the books. The information
is displayed on the LCD screen, which shows details such as the book title, author, and
location within the library. The anti-theft feature is triggered by the removal of a book
without proper checkout procedures, causing the alarm system to sound. The system&#39;s dual
power source ensures uninterrupted operation, as the battery takes over in case of power
outages. Overall, this RFID-based book management and anti-theft system provides an
efficient solution for libraries to manage their book inventory and secure their valuable assets.",SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

threat to rice production due to their ability to rapidly multiply and spread. This study was conducted to
develop an automated monitoring and molluscicide machine using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, with the
aim of creating an environment free of Golden Apple snails at the early stage of rice planting to promote
optimal growth and development of rice plants. The main purpose of this research is to automate the
process of spraying molluscicide to prevent the infestation of Golden Apple Snails during the early stages
of rice planting, specifically within the first 4 to 5 weeks. This will be accomplished by a machine
equipped with a camera that captures images of the snail in the rice field, and a Raspberry Pi that analyzes
the images using a convolutional neural network to determine if the area is infested with Golden Apple
Snails. Before the machine can function automatically, it depends on external factors such as positioning
it at the starting point of the scanning area and setting the length and number of turns to be made. The
researcher performed three sets of trials in a controlled rice field environment, with each trial consisting
of 15 snails that were later dispersed in the field. The results of the test showed that while moving through
the paddy field, the machine had an accuracy rate ranging from 76% to 93% in detecting and spraying
molluscicide on the snails.",SDG: Goal 15: Life on Land
